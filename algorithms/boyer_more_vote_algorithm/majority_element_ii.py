229. Majority Element II
https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Input: nums = [1] -> [1]
Input: nums = [1,2] -> [1,2]
